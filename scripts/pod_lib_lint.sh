podspec is the podspec to lint

options can be any options for pod spec lint

Optionally, ALT_SOURCES can be set in the script to add extra repos to the
search path. This is useful when API's to core dependencies like FirebaseCore
or GoogleUtilities and the public podspecs are not yet updated.

# Set ALT_SOURCES like the following to continue lint testing until release when Utilities
# or Core APIs change. GoogleUtilities.podspec and FirebaseCore.podspec should be
# manually pushed to a temporary Specs repo. See
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/private-cocoapods.
