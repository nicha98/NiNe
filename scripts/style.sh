#
# With no arguments, formats all eligible files in the repo
# Pass a branch name to format all eligible files changed since that branch

# Commonly
# ./scripts/style.sh master

# Strip the clang-format version output down to the major version. Examples:
#   clang-format version 7.0.0 (tags/google/stable/2018-01-11)
#   clang-format version google3-trunk (trunk r333779)
