# 3.4.0
- [fixed] Ensure that users don't accidently invoke `Storage()` instead of `Storage.storage()`.
  If your code calls the constructor of Storage directly, we will throw an assertion failure,
  instead of crashing the process later as the instance is used (#3282).

- [fixed] Fixed potential `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` violation in the internal logic for processing finished downloads (#1565, #1747).

# v3.0.0

- [changed] The `maxOperationRetryTime` timeout now applies to calls to `StorageReference.getMetadata(completion:)` and `StorageReference.updateMetadata(completion:)`. These calls previously used the `maxDownloadRetryTime` and `maxUploadRetryTime` timeouts.
