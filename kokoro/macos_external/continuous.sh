# Placeholder script to test GitHub webhooks. Eventually this script
# should be replaced by one job per test target.

# Here's an example of one build target in travis manually migrated
# to kokoro with no shared components:

cd ${KOKORO_ARTIFACTS_DIR}/github/firebase-ios-sdk

export PROJECT="Firestore"
export PLATFORM="iOS"
export METHOD="xcodebuild"

# before_install:
./kokoro/shared/before_install.sh

# Force xcpretty to use UTF8
export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8

pushd ZipBuilder

bundle install
pod repo update
swift run ReleasePackager -zipPods "../kokoro/shared/jazzy_build.json" \
  -templateDir $(pwd)/Template \
  -updatePodRepo false

popd
