/**
 *  Update the subscription associated with the given token and topic.
 *
 *  For a to-be-created subscription we check if the client is already
 *  subscribed to the topic or not. If subscribed we should have the
 *  subscriptionID in the cache and we return from there itself, else we call
 *  the FIRMessaging backend to create a new subscription for the topic for this client.
 *
 *  For delete subscription requests we delete the stored subscription in the
 *  client and then invoke the FIRMessaging backend to delete the existing subscription
 *  completely.
 *
 *  @param token        The token associated with the device.
 *  @param topic        The topic for which the subscription should be updated.
 *  @param options      The options to be passed in to the subscription request.
 *  @param shouldDelete If YES this would delete the subscription from the cache
 *                      and also let the FIRMessaging backend know that we need to delete
 *                      the subscriptionID associated with this topic.
 *                      If NO we try to create a new subscription for the given
 *                      token and topic.
 *  @param handler      The handler to invoke once the subscription request
 *                      finishes.
